<h3><strong>FRENCH'S FRIED ONION CHICKEN RECIPE</strong></h3>
<p>This recipe uses French's Crispy Fried Onions as a breading for oven-fried chicken breast cutlets. If you're not familiar with the little gems, they're made with real onions that are coated and seasoned with salt, wheat flour and dextrose, then fried in palm oil. That's it! No other ingredients, artificial flavors, or GMOs.</p> <p>In addition to the crispy chicken coating, we keep a can of the fried onions in our pantry and use them as toppings on dishes like my favorite Green Bean Casserole or a Smoked Sausage Pasta Bake. They're also delicious on salads (in lieu of croutons), on bowls of chili, or on hamburgers.</p>
<h4></stong>INGREDIENTS<strong><h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
  <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry French onion soup mix</li>

<h5>DIRECTIONS/ STEPS FOR PREPARATION<h5>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

  <li>Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Brush chicken breasts with the mayonnaise mixture. Cover with the crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
