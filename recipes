<h4>FRENCH'S FRIED ONION CHICKEN RECIPE</h4>
<p>This recipe uses French's Crispy Fried Onions as a breading for oven-fried chicken breast cutlets. If you're not familiar with the little gems, they're made with real onions that are coated and seasoned with salt, wheat flour and dextrose, then fried in palm oil. That's it! No other ingredients, artificial flavors, or GMOs.</p> <p>In addition to the crispy chicken coating, we keep a can of the fried onions in our pantry and use them as toppings on dishes like my favorite Green Bean Casserole or a Smoked Sausage Pasta Bake. They're also delicious on salads (in lieu of croutons), on bowls of chili, or on hamburgers.</p>
